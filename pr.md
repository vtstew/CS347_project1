1. What did you like about this website?
    
    I really liked how the website was organized. The nav bar was really
    cool and I liked the drop-down functionality. I also liked how you were 
    able to lay text over the images of the different families. This definitely
    saved space and kept that page from looking too clunky.

2. Describe one significant difference between your own P1 site and this person's. E.g.

    One big difference between our two sites would be the way your nav-bar is set up. I just chose
    to have all of my options on one line, where you went for a more broken up approach. I think
    your solution conserves space and helps the nav-bar look better on different size screens. However,
    I think if people don't know that they're drop down-bars on mobile that they might miss those pages.

    1. Which has a better user experience (and why)?

    I think our websites have a very similar user experience. The only difference might be on mobile
    it might be difficult to navigate using the drop down buttons. It's kind of hard to tell on mobile
    that they drop down to reveal more options

    2. Which codebase do you think would be more maintainable (and why)?

    I think both of our sites are both pretty maintainable. Your site might have the slight edge
    as you have a more consistent style throughout your pages and also your HTML files are very
    neatly organized.

3. Is the code well-structured within files, and well-organized between files and directories?

    Yes, the html files are especially well-organized. Other than that, all of the images and css
    files are in different folders and are organized well. CSS files in general are pretty messy
    and just linearly defined so I don't see anything wrong with yours.

    1. if not, suggest some specific improvements

4. Did you find any other issues? If so, briefly enumerate them.

    1. were semantically appropriate elements selected

    Everything that I saw had either an id or class that needed to have one. Your headers were 1
    thing that I saw that didn't have an id. I'm not sure if this is bad practice or not to not have
    an id for them.

    2. is the CSS refactored to limit duplication?

    Yes, I saw that there was a CSS file titled style-sheet-project1.css which outlined everything needed
    for the nav-bar. Each HTML file includes this CSS file in the header which helps limit the amount of
    CSS code that is duplicated for each file.

5. Do you have any other constructive comments for the author?

    I would just work to include more pictures / visuals for the history and facts pages. Both of them have
    really good information, but it can be easy to get lost in all of the text. I think 1-2 images per page
    would help keep viewers engaged.
